Keras implementation of Multi Source Learning using Deep and Convolutional Neural Networks with Ensembling

Modular architecture definitions are in NNetModelDefinitions.py

The use of these models and all data pre-processing are in the iSM_baseline_CNN.py and iSM_baseline_DNN.py files

All models have been developed using the mPower dataset which cannot be shared without permission
